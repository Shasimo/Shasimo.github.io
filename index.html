    <section id="Abstract">
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This page is the gathering of our effort put in the understanding of the "Shortest Paths in Portalgons" problem
        following the reading of the paper written by Löffler, Ophelders, Staals, I.Silveira [1] in the scope of the
        "Computational Geometry INFO-F420" ULB course given by Pr. Stefan Langerman.
        We present after a brief introduction the description of a shortest path map output by an algorithm taking a
        source point allowing fast queries on the pre-processed portalgon.
        We vividly encourage any interested reader to pursue the reading of this page with the reading the referenced
        paper [1] for further details.

    <section id="Introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
          A portalgon is a pair \(\mathcal{P}=(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{E})\) where \(\mathcal{F}\) is a set of
      <i>fragments</i> and \(\mathcal{E}\) is a set of <i>portals</i>.<br>
          A fragment is a simple polygon.
          A portal is an unordered pair \(e=(e^-,e^+)\) of (distinct) directed edges of same length across any fragments.

      <h2>SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF A PORTALGON</h2>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        Portalgons are a generalization of polyhedral surfaces.<br>
        Any polyhedron can be converted into an equivalent portalgon taking \(\mathcal{F}\) to be the set of (polygonal)
        faces of the polyhedron and placing a portal between two fragments wherever the two corresponding faces in the
        original polyhedron met.
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/cubeWithPortals.png" alt="Portalgon representing a cube" />
        <figcaption>Figure 1. A portalgon equivalent to a cube and a shortest path on its surface.</figcaption>
      </figure>
        The shortest path problem on the surface of a polyhedron thus reduces to a shortest path problem in a portalgon.
        Since multiple routes might lead to our destination, this problem remains tedious.<br>

      <p>
          Pushing the idea further, portalgons allow us to represent any shape we would be able to build by gluing and folding
        polygons made out of paper (note that this enables us to build more than just polyhedra).
        For instance, this means that we are able to construct a portalgon that is equivalent to a Möbius strip or the
          curved surface of a cylinder.

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/möbiusStrip.png" alt="Portalgon representing a Möbius strip"/>
      <figcaption>Figure 2. A portalgon equivalent to a Möbius strip.</figcaption>
    </figure>

          <img src="assets/images/cylinder.png" alt="Portalgon representing a cylinder"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 3. A portalgon equivalent to the curved surface of a cylinder.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        When gluing the different fragments of a portalgon \(\mathcal{P}\) together, we obtain a surface \(\Sigma\).
        It turns out that \(\Sigma\) may not be embeddable in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) or \(\mathbb{R}^3\) without
      self-intersections (or, as we have seen, with flat faces).
      We say that \(\mathcal{P}\) is a <i>representation</i> of \(\Sigma\).
      A surface can have multiple representations.

      <p>
        Crucially, this last fact enables us to compute shortest paths on some curved surfaces and self-intersecting
        surfaces.

    <section id="Inputs">
      <h3>Build your own portalgon</h3>
      <p>
        Before going into specifics, we invite the reader to design a portalgon using our tool here under.
        This way, the created portalgon will become the subject of all further modifications and explanations.
      <p>
        <i>Usage of the tool:</i>
        <ol>
        <li>Click on the grid and create a fragment (must be a simple polygon).</li>
      <li>When the current fragment is done, press <i>Next Fragment</i> and repeat until you have finished creating
      your fragments (two fragments cannot overlap).</li>
      <li>When every fragment is created, press <i>Next Fragment</i> one last time and press <i>Pick Portals</i>.</li>
      <li>To place a portal, click on the dominant vertex of the edge you want to select to be an end of the portal and
      then select another edge <i>(remember that the two edges of a portal must be of the same length!)</i>.
      Clicking again of the dominant vertex of one of the ends of a portal toggles its direction.</li>
      <li>When the current portal is done, click <i>Next Portal</i> and repeat until you are done placing portals.</li>
      <li>When everything is done, press <i>Next Portal</i> one last time and click <i>Finish</i>. You are done!</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="Shortest Paths">
      <h3>Shortest Paths</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        A shortest path in a portalgon is the shortest path between a pair of points lying within its underlying surface,
        source and destination, such that this is the shortest distance between the two points.
        There can in fact be multiple shortest paths between the two points as we are allowed to cross through portals.
        Being intrinsicly polyhedral, meaning that can take place in the third dimension, we need to think carefully about
        the procedures we will use in order to find such a path, as finding a shortest path now requires to handle more
        spaces or fragments that may lead to multiple crossings of the same portal which could lead to an unbounded
        amount of crossings on some cases.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="Signatures">
      <h3>Paths and Signatures</h3>
      We define a path \(\pi:[0,1]\rightarrow \Sigma\) to be a function representing the path from a source point
      \(s\in\Sigma\) to a destination point \(d\in\Sigma\) such that \(\pi(0)=s\) and \(\pi(1)=d\).
      Note that the definition of a path is independent of the representation of the surface
      \(\Sigma\) the path is located in (i.e. a portalgon).
      For clarity, we will see paths as a collection of disconnected segments of lines from \(s\) to \(d\) in the input
      portalgon.
      In a portalgon \(\mathcal{P}\), a path is split into a set of maximal subpaths \(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_k\) such that
      every \(\pi_i\) is fully contained into a single fragment of \(\mathcal{P}\).
      The length of a path \(\pi\) is defined to be the sum of the length of every \(\pi_i\).

      <p>
        This formal definition is not practical to work with programmatically.
        To solve this issue, we note that a path \(\pi\) may be fully described as the sequence of vertices and portals
        \(s=v_1,~e_1,\ldots,~e_k,~v_{k+1}=t\) it passes through.
        Observe that in the context of shortest paths, the vertices \(v_i\neq s,t\) have to be vertices of the fragments.

      <p>
      We define the <i>signature</i> of a path, denoted \(\sigma(\pi)\) to be this sequence (without the destination).

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/exampleSignature.png" alt="signatureExample"/>
        <figcaption>Figure 4. An example of a path \(\pi\) from \(s\) to \(d\) with signature
          \(\sigma(\pi)=v,e_1,e_2,e_3\).</figcaption>

    </section>

    <section id="Embedding of a signature">
      <h3>Embedding of a signature</h3>
      Let \(\mathcal{P}=(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{E})\) be an input portalgon.
      To embed a signature \(\sigma(\pi)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), take the ordered sequence of portals
      \(E=(e_1,e_2,\ldots e_k)\subseteq \mathcal{E}\) it contains.
      Let \(F_0\) be the fragment that contains the source point.
      For each portal \(e_i=(e_i^-, e_i^+)\in E\), assume that \(e_i^-\) is an edge of \(F_{i-1}\) and \(e_i^+\)
      is an edge of \(F_{i}\) with \(\{F_0,\ldots,F_k\}\subseteq \mathcal{F}\).
      For each edge \(e_i\in E\), we will stitch \(F_{i-1}\) with \(F_{i}\) by gluing \(e_i^-\) with \(e_i^+\) according to their direction.

      <p>
        This way, to embed \(F_i\), rotate it and translate it in order to align the starts of \(e_i^-\) and \(e_i^+\).
        In some cases, \(F_{i-1}\) and \(F_i\) might overlap after such transformations.
        If that it the case, take the reflection of \(F_i\) with \(e_i\) as the axis of symmetry.
        Note that rotation, translation and refection are all isometries.

    </section>

    <section id="SPMtoEdges">
      <h2>Shortest Path Map to the portals</h2>

      The goal of the algorithm that we are building is to compute the shortest path map from a source point
      \(s\in\Sigma\) (denoted \(SPM:=SPM(s)\)).
      A \(SPM\) is a subdivision of \(\Sigma\) into maximally connected regions such that in all regions
      \(R\in\textit{SPM}(s)\), the signature of the shortest path from \(s\) to \(p\) is the same for all \(p\in R\).

      <p>
      To compute the whole \(SPM\), we must start by computing \(SPM_e\) for every portal \(e\in\mathcal{E}\).
      We define \(SPM_e\) to be a subdivision of \(e\) into maximally connected segments \(S\subseteq e\) where the
      signature of the shortest path from \(s\) to \(p\) is the same for all \(p\in S\).
      This way, \(SPM_e\) gives the shortest path from \(s\) to any point of \(e\).

      <section id="Distance">
        <h3>Distance</h3>
        Let us say that we would like to find \(SPM_e\) for some portal \(e\).
        Let \(\pi\) be a shortest path from \(s\) to some point where \(e\) is the last portal in \(\sigma(\pi)\).
        Let \(v\) be the last vertex in \(\sigma(\pi)\).
        We define \(I_{\sigma(\pi),e}\) to be the interval of points on \(e\) that can be reached in a straight line
      from \(v\) (i.e. the interval of points that are visible from \(v\)).

        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/intervalExample.png" alt="intervalExample"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 6. Example of \(I_{\sigma(\pi), e_5}\) (the interval of points between \(L\) and \(W\))
            for a signature \(\sigma(\pi)=s,\ldots, v, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5\).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        We can now define the length of a shortest path of signature \(\sigma(\pi)\) from a source \(s\) to some point
      \(q\in e\), given the distance from \(s\) to \(v\) (\(d(s,v)\)), as following:

        \[f_{\sigma(\pi)\mid e}:e\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}:q\mapsto
        \begin{cases}
        d(s,v)+\left\|\overline{vq}\right\| & \text{if \(q\in I_{\sigma(\pi),e}\)}\\
        \infty                              & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}\]

      The two cases are justified by the fact that, clearly, if \(q\notin I_{\sigma(\pi),e}\), \(q\) is unreachable
      using the signature \(\sigma(\pi)\).

      </section>

      <section id="Envelopes">
        <h3>Envelopes</h3>

        Clearly, \(f_{\sigma(\pi),e}\) is a symmetric function, increasing as the distance to its minimum increases.
        Except these facts, the exact shape of a distance function \(f_{\sigma(\pi),e}\) is of no importance.
        <p>
          Let \(e\) be some portal.
          Take every path \(\pi\) from \(s\) with a signature \(\sigma(\pi)\) that ends in \(e\).
          For all of these signatures, we can plot \(f_{\sigma(\pi),e}\).
          The very important fact to notice is that the lower <i>envelope</i> of this set of functions is \(SPM_e\)!
        Indeed, the interval of \(e\) in which some signature \(\sigma\) gives a minimal distance function is an
        interval where the signature \(\sigma\) is optimal.
